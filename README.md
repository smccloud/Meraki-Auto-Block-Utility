# Meraki-Auto-Block-Utility
Automatically blocks an IP in a Meraki Firewall based on Microsoft Exchange Front End 1035 events in the Application Event Log.

This project came about because I need a way to do it at work and could not find a free solution.  However, I make no guarantees that it will work correctly for you.

Don't expect great comments, although I will do my best.

Developed using Visual Studio 2019 Commnity in C# (the last language I programmed for a profession using).
